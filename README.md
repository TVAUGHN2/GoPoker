# GoPoker
(WORK IN PROGRESS) 
This is a basic deterministic poker engine for best hand. 
It will take input of many n based card hands, determine the best 5 card hand from each, and then compare the hands against each other to determine the best hand. 

TODOs: 
 *  Move logic to  separate files. 
 * 	Setup REST api.
 *  Add concurrency.
 *  Apply idiomatic Golang test harness.
 *	Convert fmt to logging framework.
